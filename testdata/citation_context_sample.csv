1965741457␞␞None␞0907.2577␞␞0907.2578␞In MAINCIT , we proved the following result, which settled a conjecture in the folklore of mirror symmetry theory.
1965741457␞␞None␞0907.2577␞␞0907.2578␞The conjecture was subsequently fully proved as one of the main results in MAINCIT .
1965741457␞␞None␞0907.2577␞␞0907.2578␞A rather general result in this direction has already been obtained in MAINCIT .
1965741457␞␞None␞0907.2577␞␞0907.2578␞The purpose of the present paper is to sharpen this earlier result for wide classes of special choices of the parameters occurring in MAINCIT .
1965741457␞␞None␞0907.2577␞␞0907.2578␞Obviously, the mirror map FORMULA can be expressed as a product of the series FORMULA , namely as FORMULA The special case of the afore-mentioned Theorem 2 from MAINCIT where FORMULA (with FORMULA occurrences of FORMULA ) addressed the above question of “maximal integral roots” for the mirror-type map FORMULA .
1965741457␞␞None␞0907.2577␞␞0907.2578␞It reads as follows: FORMULA As we remarked in MAINCIT , this result is optimal in the case that FORMULA ; that is, no integer FORMULA larger than FORMULA can be found such that FORMULA .
1965741457␞␞None␞0907.2577␞␞0907.2578␞Namely, if one compares the definition of FORMULA in (REF ) with the following alternative way to write the integer FORMULA occurring in (REF ), FORMULA we see that Theorem REF is always at least as strong as MAINCIT , and it is strictly stronger if FORMULA and FORMULA for some prime FORMULA less than or equal to FORMULA .
1965741457␞␞None␞0907.2577␞␞0907.2578␞We remark that strengthenings of MAINCIT in the spirit of Theorem REF for more general choices of the parameters can also be obtained by our techniques but are omitted here.
1965741457␞␞None␞0907.2577␞␞0907.2578␞Even if the series FORMULA appears in the identity (REF ), which relates the mirror map FORMULA to the series FORMULA (with FORMULA and FORMULA ), Theorem REF does not imply an improvement over MAINCIT , which we recall here for convenience.

1965741457␞␞None␞0907.2577␞␞0907.2578␞Its (simple) proof can be found in MAINCIT .
1965741457␞␞None␞0907.2577␞␞0907.2578␞This enables us to get the following lemma, whose proof is given in MAINCIT and will not be repeated here.

2037152246␞␞1820663283␞None␞␞1303.5835␞Scalar Interactions In this subsection we show how the model handled in MAINCIT appears as a specific example of our more general formulation.
2037152246␞␞1820663283␞None␞␞1303.5835␞According to (REF ), it reads: FORMULA Since the terminal cost is of the form FORMULA , given our definition of differentiability with respect to the variable FORMULA , we know, as a generalization of (REF ), that FORMULA reads FORMULA Therefore, the terminal condition FORMULA can be rewritten as FORMULA which is exactly the terminal condition used in MAINCIT once we remark that the `tildes' can be removed since FORMULA has the same distribution as FORMULA .
2037152246␞␞1820663283␞None␞␞1303.5835␞Here is a typical example borrowed from MAINCIT : if FORMULA and FORMULA do not depend on FORMULA , then the function FORMULA is convex if FORMULA is convex and FORMULA is non-decreasing and convex.
2037152246␞␞1820663283␞None␞␞1303.5835␞Similarly, FORMULA can be identified to the FORMULA -valued function defined by FORMULA and the dynamic part of the adjoint equation (REF ) rewrites: FORMULA which again, is exactly the adjoint equation used in MAINCIT once we remove the `tildes'.

2037152246␞␞1503244063␞None␞␞1108.5590␞Since the terms FORMULA with FORMULA (see (REF )) have more general feature than the corresponding one in MAINCIT , CIT and CIT , we have to introduce FORMULA in our adjoint equation, which is slight different from FORMULA .

2037152246␞␞2048138547␞None␞␞1210.5771␞The Hamiltonian FORMULA appearing in (REF ) is defined, for any random variable FORMULA , as: FORMULA This result is proven in MAINCIT (with the assumption that FORMULA is convex and that FORMULA is convex in the variable FORMULA ).
2037152246␞␞2048138547␞None␞␞1210.5771␞The sufficiency condition is given by (see MAINCIT as well): Theorem 2.1 Assume that FORMULA is convex in FORMULA ; the partial derivatives FORMULA and FORMULA are non-negative; the Hamiltonian FORMULA is convex in FORMULA ; the function FORMULA is affine and the functions FORMULA and FORMULA are convex; where the Hamiltonian function FORMULA is defined as: FORMULA If FORMULA satisfies (REF ) for some control process FORMULA , if FORMULA and FORMULA form a pair of adjoint processes and if (REF ) holds for all FORMULA (almost surely), then the control FORMULA is optimal.
2037152246␞␞2048138547␞None␞␞1210.5771␞From MAINCIT , we know that the FBSDE (REF ) just provides a necessary condition for the optimal states of the optimization problem.
2037152246␞␞2048138547␞None␞␞1210.5771␞On the other hand, as we explained in the special case of scalar interactions derived from MAINCIT , the forward-backward system associated with the MKV control problem involves additional terms coming from the need to optimize with respect to the interaction terms.
2037152246␞␞2056973688␞None␞␞1210.0628␞On the other hand, since the works CIT and CIT on the mean-field BSDEs, there are many works on its generalizations, e.g., Wang CIT studied backward doubly SDEs of mean-field type and its applications; Shi, Wang and Yong CIT studied backward stochastic Volterra integral equations of mean-field type; Li and Luo CIT studied reflected BSDEs of mean-field type, they proved the existence and the uniqueness for reflected mean-field BSDEs; and also its applications, e.g., Andersson, Djehiche MAINCIT , Bensoussan, Sung, Yam and Yung CIT , Buckdahn, Djehiche and Li CIT , Li CIT , Yong CIT .
2037152246␞␞1821455959␞None␞␞1404.5741␞If one considers a centralized controlling interacting particle system, instead of every particle having the free will to choose its own control as formulated in MFGs, a stochastic control problem of mean field type would be resulted (see Andersson and Djehiche MAINCIT ).

2059293512␞␞2491592120␞1307.3559␞␞1608.00041␞Discussion We employed the MMPW model MAINCIT for the landscape to study inflation in the limit of a large number of fields.
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞One such class of potentials, recently studied in MAINCIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , can be constructed using non-equilibrium random matrix theory techniques.
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞According to the prescription of MAINCIT , the computational difficulties of multifield inflation can be substantially mitigated by realising FORMULA only locally along the field trajectory (while being undetermined elsewhere in field space), and by postulating that the Hessian matrix evolves according to Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) along the inflationary path.
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞However, the random matrix theory method of MAINCIT is not suitable to investigate the generation of primordial non-Gaussianities during inflation: the Brownian motion of the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix is continuous but not differentiable, and the third derivatives of the potential, required for the computation of the three-point correlation function, are not well-defined in the continuum limit.This obstacle may be overcome by regularisation, or by modifying the rules governing the stochastic evolution (cf. CIT for one suggestion).
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞Fortunately, our construction of GRF models in this paper and the construction of random DBM potentials of MAINCIT , CIT now provide two such classes of theories, thus allowing the first critical tests of possible `universal' predictions of random manyfield models of inflation.
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞We refer the reader to references MAINCIT , CIT for a more detailed discussion on the properties of DBM potentials.
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞Comparison of DBM and GRF potentials The DBM construction of MAINCIT led to the first explicit studies of models of inflation with many interacting fields in random potentials.
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞In MAINCIT however, it was shown that some aspects of the DBM models at large FORMULA (such as the distribution of e-folds), could be modelled by a single-field model.
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞Hyperparameters can transition from stiff to sloppy A key finding of reference MAINCIT was that `eigenvalue repulsion' sharply reduces the duration of inflation near a critical point of the DBM potentials: even if the curvature of the potential is fine-tuned to be small at the critical point, small cross-couplings in the Hessian cause the curvature to grow in the neighbourhood of the critical point.
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞As a consequence, it was shown in MAINCIT that the number of e-folds becomes independent of FORMULA for FORMULA .
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞In DBM models, several of the predictions at large FORMULA can be explained by eigenvalue repulsion MAINCIT , CIT , CIT .
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞We have furthermore critically assessed the similarities and differences between our models and those recently constructed using the random matrix theory `DBM' technique MAINCIT , CIT , CIT .
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞A key motivation for the construction of MAINCIT is that inflation is only sensitive to the scalar potential in the vicinity of the field trajectory, while being independent of its properties elsewhere in field space.
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞The starting point of the `DBM construction' is the scalar potential defined up to quadratic order around the point FORMULA , FORMULA Here, FORMULA sets the vertical scale of the potential, the convention for the prefactor FORMULA is explained in MAINCIT , CIT , and FORMULA sets the horizontal scale of the potential (we will shortly return to the interpretation of this parameter).
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞To study multifield inflation with randomly interacting fields, reference MAINCIT considered a stochastic evolution law for FORMULA , leading to an ensemble of random scalar potentials for each initial choice of parameters.
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞In MAINCIT , the law governing the generation of FORMULA was then chosen so that, over large distances, FORMULA samples the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of random symmetric matrices.
2059293512␞␞2760270506␞1307.3559␞␞1709.10076␞In MAINCIT , the DBM construction was used to gain access to inflation in scalar potentials with multiple interacting fields, and in CIT , CIT , these were used to, for the first time, study the observational predictions of manyfield models of inflation.
2059293512␞␞1962936557␞1307.3559␞␞1404.2601␞The techniques described above have a wealth of applications, most notably to the problem of characterizing inflation in a potential with many fields CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , MAINCIT , which we will briefly discuss in §, §REF , §REF , and §REF .

2059293512␞␞2734704143␞1307.3559␞␞1707.03520␞With this assumption, the authors of MAINCIT , CIT , CIT have reached two striking conclusions.
2059293512␞␞2734704143␞1307.3559␞␞1707.03520␞Refs. MAINCIT , CIT , CIT attribute these results to the fact that the statistics of Hessian eigenvalues in GOE is related to that of a gas of particles on a line interacting via a repulsive potential, resulting in `eigenvalue repulsion'.
2059293512␞␞2734704143␞1307.3559␞␞1707.03520␞In contrast to Refs. MAINCIT , CIT , CIT , we find that the dynamics is effectively one-dimensional, without steepening, once the slow-roll conditions are satisfied.
2059293512␞␞2734704143␞1307.3559␞␞1707.03520␞This is in contrast with the picture suggested by the Dyson Brownian Motion (DBM) model MAINCIT , CIT , CIT , asserting that inflation in a large landscape is generically multi-field, with a number of fields having small masses and participating in the slow roll.

2059293512␞␞1964222925␞1307.3559␞␞1401.6187␞We will find that at generic points the model of a GOE landscape introduced in Ref. MAINCIT is a good approximation to the Hessian matrix of a Gaussian random field.

2059293512␞␞1964222925␞1307.3559␞␞1401.6187␞Marsh et al. proposed another, more efficient algorithm to generate random landscapes in Ref. MAINCIT .
2059293512␞␞1964222925␞1307.3559␞␞1401.6187␞In Ref. MAINCIT a GOE landscape is defined by demanding that the Hessian matrix is in Wigner's Gaussian orthogonal ensemble and evolves over field space via Dyson Brownian motion CIT , CIT .
2059293512␞␞1964222925␞1307.3559␞␞1401.6187␞This question has been addressed in a series of previous works by assuming that the Hessian matrix is well approximated by a Wigner ensemble (see Refs. MAINCIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT ).
2059293512␞␞1964222925␞1307.3559␞␞1401.6187␞This is a crucial difference compared to GOE landscapes considered in previous works MAINCIT , CIT , CIT .
2059293512␞␞1964222925␞1307.3559␞␞1401.6187␞Following Ref. MAINCIT there are two regimes in which the slow roll parameters are suppressed.
2059293512␞␞1964222925␞1307.3559␞␞1401.6187␞This comprises one of the crucial differences between Gaussian random fields and GOE landscapes introduced in Ref. MAINCIT , where the Hessian is chosen to be an uncorrelated Wigner matrix.
2059293512␞␞2204438381␞1307.3559␞␞1512.04224␞As noted in MAINCIT , a further conceptual shortcoming of applying random matrix theory is that the diagonal elements of the Hessian are not independent from each other or the off-diagonal elements, and vice versa.
2059293512␞␞2204438381␞1307.3559␞␞1512.04224␞The computational limitation of globally defined random potentials is well known and can be alleviated by constructing the potential locally around the trajectory MAINCIT , CIT , CIT .
2059293512␞␞2624870529␞1307.3559␞␞1706.03774␞Our approach is to sample a large class of randomly generated inflationary models following the Random Matrix theory (RMT) method first developed in MAINCIT (for other applications of RMT in early universe cosmology, see for example CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT ).
2059293512␞␞2624870529␞1307.3559␞␞1706.03774␞Key to overcoming the challenges associated with multiple-field effects is the local procedure first introduced in MAINCIT , which we now review.
2059293512␞␞2624870529␞1307.3559␞␞1706.03774␞We have here followed the convention of MAINCIT and introduced an explicit FORMULA prefactor in the potential.
2059293512␞␞2624870529␞1307.3559␞␞1706.03774␞However, reference MAINCIT argued that for FORMULA , this type of inflation is more rare than `approximate saddle-point inflation' occurring as the field passes close to an approximate critical point of the potential.
2059293512␞␞2624870529␞1307.3559␞␞1706.03774␞We first fix the degeneracy of Eq. (REF ) by taking FORMULA .In comparison, Ref. MAINCIT chose FORMULA which gives a sharp reduction in the number of efolds generated as FORMULA is increased (with all else constant).
2059293512␞␞2624870529␞1307.3559␞␞1706.03774␞As we have seen in §REF (see also Ref. MAINCIT ), FORMULA quickly aligns with the eigendirection of the smallest eigenvalue of FORMULA during slow-roll inflation.
2059293512␞␞2624870529␞1307.3559␞␞1706.03774␞For example, Morse theory inequalities are not easily verifiable given the potential in only a small subset of the field space MAINCIT .
2059293512␞␞2624870529␞1307.3559␞␞1706.03774␞For example, a simple model of a single canonically normalised inflaton field subject to the potential, FORMULA with FORMULA (so that FORMULA for FORMULA ) provides, for certain choices of the parameters, a rather accurate estimate of the total number of efolds of the more complicated DBM models MAINCIT .
2059293512␞␞2624870529␞1307.3559␞␞1706.03774␞FIGURE In Ref. MAINCIT , it was found that the the Dyson Brownian motion of the Hessian matrix quickly spoils any fine-tuning of the eigenvalue spectrum made in the first patch: already a short distance (FORMULA ) away from the approximate critical point, the Hessian matrix develops small off-diagonal terms which cause `eigenvalue relaxation' and a prompt erasure of any tuning of the curvature of the potential.
2059293512␞␞2624870529␞1307.3559␞␞1706.03774␞Reference MAINCIT found that the distribution of the number of efolds generated by DBM models become independent of FORMULA as FORMULA .
2059293512␞␞2624870529␞1307.3559␞␞1706.03774␞For FORMULA , the spectral index becomes independent of FORMULA , consistent with the picture of eigenvalue relaxation proposed in MAINCIT .
2059293512␞␞2624870529␞1307.3559␞␞1706.03774␞For example, constructions of random scalar potentials using Gaussian Random Fields (GRFs) take the distribution of the Hessian matrix to be slightly different from that of the GOE MAINCIT , CIT , CIT .
2059293512␞␞2224240179␞1307.3559␞␞1509.06761␞The existence of strong universality theorems has motivated the employment of random matrix theory (RMT) techniques in the study of the flux landscape CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT (see also CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , MAINCIT , CIT , CIT , CIT for additional string theory motivated applications of RMT to cosmology), thus potentially providing a significant extension of the computational reach of the statistical methods.
2059293512␞␞1999371132␞1307.3559␞␞1409.5135␞This motivated Marsch et al. MAINCIT to construct the potential locally by employing Dyson Brownian motion CIT (DBM), greatly reducing the cost of numerical experiments (FORMULA ) to the point where FORMULA fields can be treated on a notebook with Mathematica.

2059293512␞␞1999371132␞1307.3559␞␞1409.5135␞The distribution of the Hessian matrix at well-separated points (i.e. separated by several units of a characteristic correlation length FORMULA ) can be restricted to any desired distribution; if Wigner's Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) is chosen, as in MAINCIT , the elements of the Hessian undergo Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) CIT .
2059293512␞␞1999371132␞1307.3559␞␞1409.5135␞Further, if the field space is FORMULA -dimensional, the FORMULA entries of the Hessian matrix FORMULA are statistically independentAnother advantage of potentials generated via DBM as opposed to a trunctaed Fourier series is this statistical independence, which truncated Fourier potentials lack, see MAINCIT for a comparison..
2059293512␞␞1999371132␞1307.3559␞␞1409.5135␞To this end, the Hessian needs to be perturbed according to (see CIT , MAINCIT , whose results we summarize here) FORMULA where FORMULA are FORMULA zero-mean stochastic variables and the term FORMULA is the uniquely determined restoring force ensuring that the distribution of the entries of the Hessian remains finite and obeys the GOE.
2059293512␞␞1999371132␞1307.3559␞␞1409.5135␞To achieve Dyson Brownian motion of FORMULA , the first two moments of FORMULA need to satisfy MAINCIT FORMULA where FORMULA represents the standard deviation of the corresponding Wigner ensemble.
2059293512␞␞1999371132␞1307.3559␞␞1409.5135␞Since FORMULA , the magnitude of a typical eigenvalue of FORMULA is of order oneThe factor of FORMULA , constitutes an overall normalization we used to remain consistent with MAINCIT .
2059293512␞␞1999371132␞1307.3559␞␞1409.5135␞As a consequence, it is unlikely that a shallow patch remains flat for FORMULA For example, such an initially flat configuration would be chosen if inflation near a saddle point is to be investigated MAINCIT ; evidently, if FORMULA is small, long bursts of inflation are unlikely.
2059293512␞␞1999371132␞1307.3559␞␞1409.5135␞This result can be quantified via random matrix theory, see e.g. CIT , CIT .. To be concrete, one can show MAINCIT that the expectation value of the smallest eigenvalue FORMULA of a matrix FORMULA undergoing DBM satisfies FORMULA where FORMULA is the initial matrix at FORMULA and FORMULA .
2059293512␞␞1999371132␞1307.3559␞␞1409.5135␞We demonstrate this eigenvalue relaxation and recover the results of Marsh et al. MAINCIT in Fig. REF , where we plot a random potential FORMULA created via Dyson Brownian motion (using (REF ) and perturbations of the form (REF ) and ()) next to the corresponding eigenvalues of the Hessian.
2059293512␞␞1999371132␞1307.3559␞␞1409.5135␞We chose FORMULA in line with MAINCIT , to enable direct comparisons.
2059293512␞␞1999371132␞1307.3559␞␞1409.5135␞To test our code, we recovered numerically the results of MAINCIT , which we omit here for reasons of brevity.
2059293512␞␞1999371132␞1307.3559␞␞1409.5135␞Discussion At this point we would like to step back and briefly compare our method to the one of Marsh et al. MAINCIT , where perturbations are added directly to the Hessian: we first note that no additional constraint is imposed onto the step length compared to the method by Marsh et.al.
2059293512␞␞1999371132␞1307.3559␞␞1409.5135␞Since the step length is the same, the computational efficiency is not improved compared to MAINCIT and in fact slightly worse, since we need to perturb FORMULA instead of FORMULA , so that more random variables need to be set at each step.

2059293512␞␞2884779150␞1307.3559␞␞1807.07654␞Chronologically one of the first attempts was due to Marsh, McAllister, Pajer and Wrase MAINCIT who proposed a method that charts the evolution of the potential near and along the classical trajectory by stipulating that the Hessian matrices in adjacent coordinate patches are related by Dyson Brownian Motion (DBM) (a detailed explanation of the method can be found in Section ).
2059293512␞␞2884779150␞1307.3559␞␞1807.07654␞There are other reasons to suspect this connection as detailed in MAINCIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT and discussed in Section .

2059293512␞␞2884779150␞1307.3559␞␞1807.07654␞This evolution, as explained in CIT , CIT , CIT , is equivalent to solving the Fokker-Planck-Smoluchowski equation for the probability density function (PDF) of FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA The stationary solution of this equation is the PDF for a matrix in the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE): FORMULA As mentioned earlier the DBM proposal to generate random potentials MAINCIT , CIT , CIT is not without complications.
2059293512␞␞2884779150␞1307.3559␞␞1807.07654␞According to previous work MAINCIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , we expect inflation to occur most often at saddle points in a RGF.

2231009150␞␞2595012769␞None␞␞1609.00639␞A further demand for scalability stems from the fact that the deconvolution problem is solved in the inner loop of constrained non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) MAINCIT , the current state of the art for simultaneous denoising, deconvolution, and demixing of spatiotemporal calcium imaging data.

2231009150␞␞2805989827␞None␞␞1807.06203␞A number of papers have focused on the first task CIT , CIT , MAINCIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT , CIT ; however, somewhat surprisingly, very little work has focused on the second task.
2231009150␞␞2805989827␞None␞␞1807.06203␞Constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) MAINCIT approaches provide state of the art denoising and demixing of calcium imaging data, but these methods can leave significant visible signal behind in the residual (discarding potentially valuable signal) and are highly dependent on the initialization of the matrix factorization; thus it would be dangerous to keep only the matrix factorization output and discard the raw data.
2231009150␞␞2805989827␞None␞␞1807.06203␞We begin by standardizing the data within a patch: for each pixel, we subtract the mean and normalize by an estimate of the noise variance within each pixel; the noise variance is estimated using the frequency-domain method described in MAINCIT , which exploits the fact that the signal and noise power are spectrally separated in movies with sufficiently high frame rates.

2231009150␞␞2805989827␞None␞␞1807.06203␞However, it is certainly possible to incorporate temporal penalties or constraints on FORMULA (e.g., a TF penalty or a non-negative auto-regressive penalty as in MAINCIT ), either within each iteration or as a final denoising step.

2765322050␞␞2896006313␞1711.00645␞␞1810.05717␞This issue has been somewhat rectified in MAINCIT , where it is shown that in order to get a representative from each monoidal equivalence class, one only needs to consider homomorphisms FORMULA up to post-composition by the inner automorphisms of FORMULA induced by the invertible bimodules FORMULA , where FORMULA .
2765322050␞␞2896006313␞1711.00645␞␞1810.05717␞For these cases, we apply the techniques developed in MAINCIT to determine which inequivalent extensions are equivalent as monooidal categories.
